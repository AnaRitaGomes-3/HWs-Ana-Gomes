# Readme HW5

## Description of the content of the repository
This HW5 folder contains 1 Jupyter source file that correspond to part 1 of HW5, and 2 python files(with and without the values already considered) that corresponds to the part II. The python file MC_ar1.py is able to be executed by typing in the command line: python MC_ar1.py 1 0.5 1.5 500 100. This read me file contains also the part 3 of HW5.



## Part 3

In this HW5, my doubts were essentially related to those that were raised in the issue.
